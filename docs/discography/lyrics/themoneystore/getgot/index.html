get get get get
got got got got
blood rush to my 
head lit hot lock
poppin off the 
fuckin block knot
clockin wrist slit 
watch bent thought bot

tail pipe draggin volume blastin bailin out my brain red light flash
dem stop i smash
abraxas, hydroplane, massive
catch this flight flow 
rainin madness
mastered mine and laced 
the ave wit black cat fish tailin waves of stratus
curb right ta far left lane

dont wait for me, if i care
bout anything, anywhere
losin myself, i get the stares
what im lookin at, wasnt there
(wasnt there)

nothin out there
cant stay inside
hit the bar, sleep deprived
who drove the car
im still alive
up in smoke, moon was low
howd you know
didnt say i did
whose is this, you know what this is.. but do you know

get get get get
got got got got
blood rush to my 
head lit hot lock
poppin off the 
fuckin block knot
clockin wrist slit 
watch bent thought bot
fly inside out 
rot dem big shot simp slot shit but a one hit quick stop

so many ways 
ta skin the frame
remember when
first got strange
now i just think it life obey
so what comes next
right away
(right away)

raise thecup, tilt it dry
come black cloud 
cover the sky
tongue through pupil 
of your eye
sickness moves you cant deny
lickin through youmastermind
for mercy man cry

yeah im knowin and 
you know why
nail through metnal 
ever dem try
pigeon hole me get crucified
cant clone this edge 
whats it cost
to lose your head
wit out end up lost
should be askin 
wheres the safe
born wit a ski mask
on my face

get get get get
got got got got
blood rush to my 
head lit hot lock
poppin off the 
fuckin block knot
clockin wrist slit 
watch bent thought bot

lycanthropic manic cycles
fire water burnin bibles
wake up ragin call a taxi
take me to the nearest city
cell light up yeah get at me make it quick though blood im busy (get busy)

drilled a hole into my head
pierced the bone and
felt the breeze
lift my thoughts out
dem sick bed
wit a pair of crow
skeleton wings
know nothin since then 
it seems
been floatin through
the nexus threadin dreams

get get get get
got got got got
blood rush to my 
head lit hot lock
poppin off the 
fuckin block knot
clockin wrist slit 
watch bent thought bot
