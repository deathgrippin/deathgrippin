<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 18px; color: red;">Beware</span> â€” from Ex Military (2011)</p>
<div class="lyricbox">
I close my eyes and seize it<br>
I clench my fists and beat it<br>
I light my torch and burn it<br>
I am the beast I worship...<br>
<br>
And I know soon come my time<br>
For in mine void a pale horse burns<br>
But I fear not the time I'm taken<br>
Past the point of no return.<br>
Wage war like no tomorrow<br>
Cuz no hell there won't be one<br>
For all who deny the struggle<br>
The triumphant overcome<br>
<br>
Trips to where, few have been<br>
Out of thin air, upon high winds<br>
Rites begin when the sun descends<br>
Have felt what few will ever know<br>
Have seen the truth beneath the glow,<br>
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow<br>
I am below, so far below<br>
The bottom line<br>
Transmitting live, transmissions rise<br>
From the depths out of controlled by<br>
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes<br>
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds<br>
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine<br>
To ride the waves, of unrest<br>
Made to make me shine as a testament<br>
To why the ways of the blind will never get<br>
Shit but shanked by my disrespect<br>
Dismiss this life, worship death<br>
Cold blood night of serpent's breath<br>
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness<br>
In the bottomless wells of emptiness<br>
Channeled to invoke what we represent<br>
<br>
Secret order<br>
Elitist horde of<br>
Creeping fire<br>
Seizing power<br>
Riders of the lupus hour<br>
Eye on palm<br>
Time is gone<br>
Moonlight drawn<br>
Fly til dawn<br>
Sacrifice to rise beyond<br>
Deep inside the violent calm<br>
Of the coming storm<br>
In blood sworn<br>
To glorify and for life adorn<br>
With all that dies to become unborn<br>
<br>
I close my eyes and seize it<br>
I clench my fists and beat it<br>
I light my torch and burn it<br>
I am the beast I worship...<br>
I am the beast I worship<br>
<br>
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns<br>
Curve like psychotropic scythes<br>
And smell of torn flesh bled dry<br>
By hell swarms of pestis flies<br>
Vomiting forth flames lit by<br>
An older than ancient force<br>
That slays this life with no remorse<br>
<br>
The spiral storm<br>
Of flames inside<br>
The torch I raise<br>
The force I ride<br>
<br>
Feel my vessel go up in flames<br>
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed<br>
Direct connection to the source<br>
Vestment of unnatural force<br>
Forever burning black torch<br>
Wisdom of the old and true<br>
Possessed by the chosen few<br>
Shining to reveal the ways<br>
Of a darkness that pervades<br>
All that is and ever was<br>
Inferno of witches blood<br>
<br>
Worship is not on bended knee<br>
Nature knows not of mercy<br>
To pray is to accept defeat<br>
Power pisses on the weak<br>
Bow and beheaded by the beast<br>
Beggar on a bitches leash<br>
Scum is desperate for relief<br>
Worship is the way I ride<br>
Witching currents through the eye<br>
Of storms that force the false to die<br>
Worship the flames with which I rise<br>
Into apocalyptic skies<br>
<br>
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone<br>
In splintered skeleton I roam<br>
Wastelands with not to call my own<br>
But the path I walk alone<br>
The hunger burns, within my gut<br>
As my bones turn into dust<br>
<br>
And I know soon come my time<br>
For in mine void a pale horse burns<br>
But I fear not the time I'm taken<br>
Past the point of no return<br>
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one<br>
For all who deny the struggle<br>
The triumphant overcome ...<br>
<br>
I close my eyes and seize it<br>
I clench my fists and beat it<br>
I light my torch and burn it<br>
I am the beast I worship...<br>
I am the beast I worship<br>
