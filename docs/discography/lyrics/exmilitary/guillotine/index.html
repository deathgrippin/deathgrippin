It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yah

Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes... 
Guillotine - yah

Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue 
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke 
Stomp music seriously - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes... 
Guillotine - yah

Can't stop the groove lics jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected

To everything you want, ever did want
We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole
And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes... 
Guillotine - yah

Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Out out out out  - yah

The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets
Out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that's ever been said - yah

Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead - yah

Yah ... guillotine - yah ... guillotine - yah

Head of a trick in a bucket
Body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it
Gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted
By the stench of rot is such a drag - yah

Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yah
Choke on these nuts til the very last - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes... 
Guillotine - yah

Serial number, killing machine
The illest of means,
To an end built on the filthy sound
you're experiencing - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes... 
Guillotine -- yah

Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixin rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel

The passion that blinds me so I feel - YAH

Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yah
