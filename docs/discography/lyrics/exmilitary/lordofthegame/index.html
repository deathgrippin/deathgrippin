<div class="lyricbox">
Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing, fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower

Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin the wheel
Flippin donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come
Fuckin cowards

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
'Pon which we maintain
Like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die

Where was I now
Like I said before
Hear someone knockin
At my front door
Who could it be, should I ignore
The knockin or see what could be in store
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia, is it real?
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel

When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

(Rather be stuck naked)
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you
Said you'd never go back.

Fuck where you're from,
Fuck where you're goin,
It's all about where you're at
